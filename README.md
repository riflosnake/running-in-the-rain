This project simulates rain particles falling over a person who moves horizontally across the screen. The goal is to measure how many raindrops hit the person as they walk, in attempt to solve the famous problem, whether it is better to walk or run during rain. The simulation includes adjustable settings for rain volume, speed, angle, and walking speed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the appâ€™s state.
- **Matter.js**: A physics engine for rendering the simulation and managing object collisions.
